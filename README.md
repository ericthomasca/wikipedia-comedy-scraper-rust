![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/ericthomasca/wikipedia-comedy-scraper-rust/rust.yml)

A simple web scraper built in Russt. It scrapes the Wikipedia page of stand-up comedy specials in 2023 and converts it to a csv... for now.

Based on [Wikipedia Comedy Scraper Go](https://github.com/ericthomasca/wikipedia-comedy-scraper-go)
